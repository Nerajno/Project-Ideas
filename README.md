# Project-Ideas
Things that pop in my head to code alone or as a group.

- [ ] Do the Github Profile thing.
- [ ] Reacty native app that tracts your steps and show it on a map, has authentication, adds walk to calender (MoonshotðŸ‘€ ).
- [ ] An app the finds all the driveIn movie theaters nearby. {auth, backend, frontend, hosted and live for both parts, has favourites and comments, has friends = MoonshotðŸ‘€ }.
